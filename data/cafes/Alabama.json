            "text": "They have so many cats right now (12/13/2024)! All of them have so much personality and they’re sooooo soft! I came here with friends as a birthday gift to myself, I’m so glad I did. It is very calming sitting with the cats! They dim the lights and play soothing music while the cats just roam around. It is also extremely clean and the restroom smells great as well! They do provide binders all around the sitting area so you can learn about each cat, along with how to adopt one if you fall in love with one of the fur babies! As well as the cat petting, they provide you one free drink — whether that be hot coffee, hot tea, soda, chocolate milk, or cold water! They also sell reasonably priced products, such as jewelry, cat toys, shot glasses, little pastries, and they even have cans of alcohol for sale (if that’s your thing!). I would 100% recommend this lovely place to anybody who even remotely enjoys cats! There are many different areas to sit, their one rule is to never pick up any of the cats.",

The owner Taura is very kind and is very involved in the process and makes sure the cats are cared for. I have NEVER been in a cleaner environment with that many animals, anywhere!! The vibe was laid back, comfortable and you would not know there were 20 cats there. You could tell they were comfortable and cared for in that environment. Those cats aren't just fosters to that business, they're family. I would give more stars if I could!!!!!",
