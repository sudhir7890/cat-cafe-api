              "text": "We originally had a very good experience and shared super positive things on Google and social media. I even had people in the Reno/Tahoe area reach out about adopting from this cafe and rescue and I gave them a rave review about our experience here. However, a few hours after our visit we noticed an extra charge to our bank account. We were charged an additional $10.00 for apparently breaking the rules. When I asked what rules were broken, I did not get a response. We were extremely respectful and honestly this is just kind of ridiculous. We cannot think of anything that we did that warrants an extra fee. I love cats and I just suffered a miscarriage not even 2 weeks ago. My husband did this for me to get me out of the house and feeling better. Its not about the money but the deception. We were never warned during our visit or told we were breaking the rules. If they had made us aware of the charge, we could have better prepared, but instead it overdrafted our spending account resulting in an extra $50 in fees. I am extremely disappointed as this is the only cat cafe in Reno and I was excited to be able to interact with cats even though we can't adopt one right now. The cats seem well taken care of but this is not good business practice. We didn't even really feel like we could relax with the cats because the staff were almost hovering. They made conversation which was nice, but we were tip-toeing around trying not to make anyone or any of the cats uncomfortable. I am truly disappointed but we've agreed we won't be back.\n\nAlso, it seems the owner's only response to people with this same experience is that the policy was agreed upon multiple times. And she's right. But it is also very sneaky to act as though everything is fine and not mention a single thing to either of us and then charge us after we've left. We agreed to the policy because we thought if anything were to happen, they would at least speak up and warn us before immediately deciding to charge us with no warning. It seems like a money-grab considering how many people its happened to.\n\nAs I can't respond to the owner's comments directly but hopefully they see this. My husband and I were informed about all of the cats before interacting with them by the older employee. While she warned us that Duchess was temperamental/not the friendliest, we were not explicitly told not to approach her. That simply was not communicated. In fact, she told us that Duchess tends to be more friendly towards men!! Which is why he went to her in the first place. My husband was told twice that the cat had reached her limit. Saying multiple times makes it seem like it was higher. He was gentle and she did not lash out. He was not scratched or bitten. She was clearly not as stressed as you make it out to seem, she did not move from the exact position she was in when he approached her. I noticed you have cameras in the cat lounge so if you were not there to observe our visit, I suggest you look at the footage. The cat was perfectly fine after the interaction and so was he. The staff never once told him to stop, they said she had reached her limit. It's fine if that is what is considered a warning, but why not tell us we were going to be charged before we left? That is deceptive. They acted as if everything was perfectly fine. They never said we were breaking the rules. He did not intend to stress her out or harm her, that was clear. I'd understand the fee if he intentionally messed with her to piss her off, but that's just not what happened.",

From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by the employees and once you enter the cat portion, a sense of tranquility instantly washes away the stresses of the outside world.\n\nThe atmosphere is serene and calming, with soft ambient music playing in the background. Their drink options are varied from hot chocolate, coffee, many types of teas, and alcoholic beverage varieties.\n\nBut the true stars of the show are, of course, the cats. Roaming freely throughout the cafe, these furry residents exude an air of contentment, basking in the attention of visitors. From playful kittens to sweet and sleepy seniors, each cat has its own unique personality, making it impossible not to fall in love at first sight.\n\nWhether you're a cat lover looking to make a new feline friend or simply seeking a new place to hang out, I highly recommend Enchanted Cat Cafe.\n\nEven after the hour in the lounge is done, it was nice to sit in the cafe and catch up with friends.",

              "text": "Just grab a coffee elsewhere and go to the other shelters to visit, adopt, and make donations.\nMy mother and sister planned to go here for a visit. They dared to ask one question regarding shoes (yes, footwear is an issue here). They have a confusing flowchart about it. We emailed for clarification. The owners response was so rude that we decided to cancel. The cancellation policy shown just before you enter payment says 24 hour notice is needed. We cancelled 1 week and 1 day ahead of time. The owner has refused to refund us. Also, there is an additional $6.00 charge that the owner can't or won't explain and also won't refund.\nI notified the owner that if we didn't receive a refund in full by 10am the next day, we would be refuting the charge as fraudulent with our bank. The owner then said I was being abusive and threatening and stopped responding.\nThis place has so many weird rules and policies, it's as if the owner would rather not have any customers all. For example, if you bring a kid that's 5 years old or younger, you must HOLD THEM the entire time, otherwise they will tack on additional charges.\nThe owner (or whomever I was speaking with) is obviously not a very experienced business owner and outright childish. You can't just make things up, gaslight people, and mess around with people's money.\nWho knew dealing with a place called the \"Kitty Cafe\" would be such a nightmare.\nTo the owner: don't bother responding with any lies, I have screenshots of the conversation as well as your website and I'll post them here if I need to.\nThey also just hit the same account with a second charge while the initial charge was being disputed with the bank. The management at this place is deeply ineffective and fraudulent.",
