I adopted my best friend, Ringo from here a couple years ago, and I couldn't be happier with that decision knowing that they believed that I was the best fit for this sweet cat. They put so much effort and time into making sure these furbabies are taken care of through their adoption process. The atmosphere is so cozy and inviting between the cafe and the cat visiting space. The kitties clearly have plenty of enrichment and precautions are taken to make sure sicknesses doesn't spread. Also, the drinks are so good! I can't praise this place enough.

I was in town for my birthday, thought how lovely it would be to see some new kitties, and took a chance to go in without a reservation.\n\nThe person at the counter was very kind. They answered my questions, got me setup for the next slot, and recommended a refreshing drink while I waited. There a purrfect photo moment wall, and some lovely cat-related books to browse and relax with.\n\nThe ambience was clean and cute. The community fliers made me feel included and welcome. And of course, the kitties!! I had been following them on social media for awhile so it was great to see firsthand the love and attention that goes into socializing these kitties and getting them to their next homes. Thank you to everyone involved in this special place!",

As someone who has always loved cats, having a little cafe on Mass street dedicated to delicious treats and adorable adoptable kitties is like a dream come true. I know several people who have adopted their kitties through the cafe and have had an amazing experience. These kitties get shown in a new light when they aren’t in a cage at a shelter. Their personality really shines through!\n\nThe cats and the treats aren’t the only good thing. I’ve had great encounters with both owners who are just amazing! Brittanie, one of the owners, knows myself and the little boy I nanny by name and is just so personable. They’ll always make you feel right at home!\n\nThank you Espurresso for all that you do for us customers and the sweet kitties that come through the Cafe.",
