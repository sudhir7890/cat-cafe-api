The cats were in the best rooms, it was almost as good as forever homes. They had everything cats could ever want. The coffee was fabulous - I had a delightful mocha and the pastries looked absolutely divine. I’d stop by there just to get coffee, even without the incentive of adorable cats!!  It is a great place to take your laptop and do some work in a chill fun environment.  The owners were both there and they were awesome - they’re vet techs as well so I can’t ever imagine a cat cafe in better hands!!   I bought gift certificates for some friends - it’s the perfect gift and totally unique!!!",

              "text": "MOUNT PURRNON CAT CAFE & WINE BAR has become a must-do for out of town kiddos visiting Northern Virginia, if you love cats and you love kiddies.\n\nMount Purrnon is located on Alfred Street just off King Street, the main 'drag' in Old Town Alexandria so everywhere you turn you are walking in historic footsteps. Parking is on the street. Payment is fed in to free standing rectangles. The receipt is placed on your car dashboard.\n\nMount Purrnon is a healthy walk towards the water with your back to the Metro. If you are lucky, you can catch Old Town's free trolley, a fun thing kids of all ages love to do. The trolley will land you near enough to the cafe allowing you to combine two kid fun events in one outing. ,\n\nThe Mount Purrnon Cafe is kitty corner to a vintage shop, around the cornerdown the street from Sephora and up the street from the amazing Torpedo Factory.\n\nEntering Mount Purrnon Cat Cafe + Wine Bar, you enter the most delightful gift shop filled with cat 'stuff' of all types, high end, crafty and lower priced fun stuff, all benefiting the charity housed in this historic house once upon a time someone, maybe, infamous in history lived there, after all, ghosts of America's fathers still live there, technically.\n\nFriendly volunteers sit waiting to take payment for adults, kids, lunch if you choose and the length of time your visit to last- 1/2 hour, an hour. I once met a young woman who pretty much spent all day there. She said she found inner peace.\n\nMount Purrnon profiles its current residents on the wall in this room so you sorta have an idea which kitties you will be greeted by upstairs AND maybe even want to take home with you if you are in the market for a furrever friend.\n\nThe stairs are a bit steep heading up to the cattery. There are steps outside, too.\n\nBefore you head up, there is a downstairs eating place with a limited menu that includes out of this world cheese melt sandwich a finicky-as-a-cat four year old I know literally inhales this sandwich. There is a cat themed bathroom on the first floor. It's sort of a nice thing to do- eat first, fill your tummy then head up the stairs.\n\nThe photos speak for themselves. I wanted to take them all but, got a better offer, two kiddos who love love love coming here to Mount Purrnon Cafe. Thank you, yet again.\n\noh yeah, photos are copyright (c) Carrie Devorah and may not be used unless given permission by me, not by google or the cafe",

The beef is beefy, the onion ring does its level best to contain the Mac& Cheese, but it will ultimately fail, and when the dam breaks...\n\nDon't get me wrong, you will LOVE everything about this burger... The pork belly and egg bring it to a 10... But there is a good chance you'll wear some of it.\n\nWe started with the onion rings, other onion rings wish they were these.\n\nOnly criticism, too many high top tables, I'm not a fan, so I took a booth.

They’re all very clean and healthy. The place is calm and welcoming for both cats and humans. The cats have a large variety of places to go play, hide, sleep, etc., and cat toys are available in every room. We loved reading about each cat and getting to know them all. We were even given treats to feed the cats. The drinks were great, and my daughter tried the (“very artistic”) red velvet cakepop.

Their matcha latte was one of the best I’ve ever had, and their oat milk vanilla latte was equally delicious. Both times I’ve went I also visited the cat lounge, you can tell the cats are very well taken care of and $15 for an hour is such a great price. Not only are the cats super cute but the money will help with their care! Will definitely be one of the coffee shops I’ll be visiting regularly.",

Wayne was a foster of ours when he was a foster fail, but Parenthesis and Banjo I found on their page. I love that they almost all have foster homes and get to live in a home while they wait to be adopted. Banjo was a senior and had quite a few issues which I knew was going to happen because I adopted him old—he recently passed but I kept in touch with his old foster and always made sure she had an update too. They boys were both in great condition when I picked them up, the only thing is they did both have tape worm fragments I noticed after a few days with them. No big deal and treated with dewormer. I know with them being shelter/feral it happens and sometimes it takes multiple treatments to get fully rid of them but that was it! Obviously with being a cat owner, I bring them to the vet for yearly check-up’s and issues, but I also did take them after I adopted just to get blood ran, any meds needed and the full check-up and cats cradle were able to provide me with all their records they had and faxed them to Harrisonburg Animal Hospital as well. They also have roll over insurance…get it!! I used it both on Banjo and Parenthesis after I adopted for dewormer and checks and it was so worth it. Go get a kitty from cats cradle 💕",

The cats are adorable and most are very sweet. Some are a bit more standoffish, but they'll let you know if they don't want to be pet. There is enough space for people and cats to roam, and plenty of cats to play with. They provide a lot of toys for you to use, and the cats have a ton of trees and perches to nap on. The space is clean and doesn't smell, and you can tell the cats are well cared for. The price for a visit is reasonable in my opinion, and it helps them care for the cats.

My husband and I waited in front of the gelato and no one even said we will be with you in a moment. 2 people literally saw us and I made contact multiple times. I stood patiently waiting and still nothing.\n\nWhile waiting, I saw a gross bug on the side of the pistachio gelato and I would have taken a photo and I would have told the workers but no one came to see if we wanted anything. I’m mentioning the bug here so that they can take it out and it won’t end up in someone’s cup. I don’t think the bug is due to a lack of cleanliness because it’s clean. I think it probably flew inside when they opened the ice cream freezer and froze to death.\n\nThere were not even a lot of people in there so it’s not acceptable to me to just ignore customers. Especially considering we had just paid for food and bottled water.\n\nEven as we walked out, there was no thank you or anything at all. The service is not good and I’m not sure if I will be back.",

The onion rings tasted like they were cooked in old, overused oil, and the hot dog was awful—seriously, you could get a better one from a food truck. To top it off, the bathroom was clogged and gross. You could tell from the food that the grill hadn’t been cleaned properly. The only saving grace was the waiter, who did a great job, but everything else was just bad. The restaurant is called Cat Cafe, but honestly, I don’t think even cats would eat the food here. We left most of it on the table. Definitely won’t be back, and if you’re thinking of visiting, do yourself a favor and read the reviews first. Total waste of money and time.",

We first had a drink server who struggled with retention of our drink order.  When he didn't return for awhile, we asked for a service.  A new woman arrived and then immediately said, 'it wasn't my fault.'  She then guessed which ones of us would be the difficult orders.  The food service was slow. The owner chatted us up while we waited for our food, telling us about her rescues.  She assured us that we could stay as long as we needed, getting dessert or after-dinner drinks.  When the time came to make the decision the waitress quickly told us the kitchen was closed.  She walked it back when I told her what the owner said, but it clearly would have been a hassle for her to do so.  The food was good.  It filled the stomach and was above average, but we might see what else we could find in the future or try to come at a less busy time.",
