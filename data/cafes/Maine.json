Both of us ordered half sandwiches, which were very generous portions, enough for a lunchtime meal. Both were such unique twists on regular chicken & tuna sandwiches that one typically gets at other establishments. The service was very fast, too. It's such a cute restaurant.  My only critique is that they didn't turn the A/C on and it was hot and stuffy inside. But that won't sway me from going back there again whenever I'm in Farmington. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

The ingredients they used were absolutely the perfect ripeness and very quality which made everything come together perfectly!!\nThe lobster omelette was excellent.  The ingredients used almost perfectly seasoned it, however a few sprinkles of salt really made it pop!\nThe sausage link is delish, and the eggs are prepared spot on!\nPerhaps the best biscuit I have ever had.  So light and airy and the strawberry butter pairs exquisitely with it.\nThe floral garden in the front is equally planned out and maintained, so no surprise the food is fantastic.\nStaff was great and they can sit you indoor, patio, or deck seating!\nOnly ate breakfast there, and would go anytime I was ever in the area.",

There is plenty of indoor seating with a great atmosphere in the winter. There is outdoor seating when the season is right. The food was extremely tasty and quickly came to our table after we ordered at the front. If you would rather have take away order, they have that option as well. Just come in and go to the left. Kid friendly. Lots of parking.",
