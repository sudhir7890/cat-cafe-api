Cosmic Cat is a small warm cafe with minimal seating and very eclectic vibe inside with its decor. There was one barista making drinks who was super friendly.\n\nI ordered just a cappuccino to try their espresso beans. My drink was good, the milk to coffee ratio felt balanced and went down smoothly. If I had one thing to pick apart, it would be that perhaps my milk was over steamed a bit as the drink came out extremely hot and burned my mouth, but after waiting a few minutes outside in the cold it was drinkable. Other than that seems like a solid spot for locals.",

The pastrami sandwich was really good and the shop is a part of over 130 years of history.\nBut there are few things to consider. First of all, the pastrami was quite fatty and after sometime, you might feel uneasy.\nSecondly, their food waste is astonishing. The 31 dollar(with tax) is sometime more than enough for 2 people and if you are alone, you are doomed. People waste so much food that it makes you sad. There should be one option for around 20 dollars with half the meat and that should satisfy most of the population.\nNevertheless, if you are a company of two, order 1 sandwich and ask them for no cheese. The meat is fatty enough, you do not need cheese on top of that.",

Their back and front doors were open and they have fans and today was warm but inside it was comfortable.\nSo if you must have AC, it won't be available here.\nThe women behind the counter today were super nice and brought my bagel to me.

We only ordered 3 items - a mango slush, a watermelon slush, and a teddy bear mousse. It took about 15-20 minutes just to get our drinks. Add an additional 20 for the small bear mousse cake. All 3 items cost roughly $25. The little mousse cake, which could’ve been devoured in 2 bites by a man was $9. I’ve had better mango slush from other bubble tea places. The watermelon slush wasn’t bad. I believe they may have used real watermelon. In any case, I probably would not revisit, but it’s a great attraction spot for little ones.

If you are even the slightest cat person I would very much so recommend coming here as it is such a heartwarming environment. An hour with the cutest cats for only $10 and some change is an amazing deal. Pawsitivitea also offers the chance to adopt a wide variety of the cats that you will see upon visiting them, with an appropriate application process. Their tea and coffee beverages never disappoint as well as their fresh treats that they serve as well! Honestly such a great cafe. Overall every time I visit I have such a pleasant experience and would (and have) recommend this place to anyone who even remotely loves cats.",

I was there for the holiday drag brunch, and it was such a great event!  I had been to drag shows before, but never a cat cafe, and my friend had been to cat cafes (Pawsitivitea specifically!) before, but never a drag show, so it was a really nice experience for us.  The cats were so fun, and it was also really nice to be in a space with other people who \"get\" cats.  Not to get too metaphysical about it, but I think cats demand a type of presence that isn't the norm in most other places in our culture.  It's nice to be around other people (and kitties!!) who really value being calm, respectful, and mindful of boundaries and subtle communication.  It's very peaceful - and the good food and drink certainly help too!  I really appreciated that everyone was so conscious of dietary restrictions too.  It was on the sign-up form, and they asked me again at the counter.  Everyone was really, really serious about not accidentally serving someone something that they can't or don't want to eat or drink.  I'm lactose intolerant and have definitely been dosed with full milk in some coffee places, so it's very noticeable to me when people are careful about it.  Thanks everyone, and I'll see you again soon!  Kiss the kitties for me!",

            "text": "We were visiting family from Michigan, walking around the little downtown area of New Paltz, when I just happened to look down a side street and see \"Cat Cafe\". My daughter is a huge \"cat lover\" and I said, \"oh my gosh, they have a cat cafe, do you want to go look in the window?\" - we lasted all of 4 seconds before we were entering the front door, looking at spending some time with the sweet babies. My daughter and I each got a drink; we were told the ground rules (nothing surprising) and were advised to wash our hands upon entering. Immediately, I had the sweetest cats at my feet, rubbing my legs, looking for all the pets and love. My daughter had so much fun, and we both enjoyed our experience. if we didn't have a 10-hour drive and 2 cats at home, we would have applied to take one home. The kittens were so cute and playful. None of the cats were aggressive or ill tempered. My tiramisu cold brew was fantastic, and my daughter had a vanilla steamer. I found this place to be fairly priced and the cats seemed very well taken care of. The staff was friendly and told us all about the cats and where they came from and their stories. My ONLY issue with the cafe, as SOON as they opened the door to where all the cats were, the smell was awful. You can tell they really do try to mask or hide the smell and with that many cats, I'd imagine it's hard to do. But I couldn't even see litter boxes and the cat urine smell was fairly strong. All in all, if you love cats and want to enjoy 30 or so minutes of feline company and a tasty coffee, check out Beans! Took home a sweatshirt to remember my fun adventure with my girl.",

            "text": "Not sure why a couple of recent reviews mentioned bad odor and scratchy cats. We were just there today and had a very pleasant experience - there were many sweet, playful kitties and no bad smells whatsoever. We haven't been to other cat cafes, and while those might be larger, this one was cozy and didn't feel cramped - there was enough space for both the visitors and the cats. All visitors are given disposable shoe covers to keep the place clean - great idea! Please note that the main door is locked, and visitors are let into the reception area in small groups to make sure the cats don't escape. There was a sign set up on the pavement, which we didn't notice, so another one on the door at the eye level would be very helpful. The volunteers were nice, gave us tips on which cats prefer being petted only on the head and answered all our questions. No food or drinks for sale, which is perfectly fine - the main purpose is to enjoy interacting with the adorable kitties and hopefully find a perfect match if you are looking to adopt.",
