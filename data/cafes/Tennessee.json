This room is a little dark on purpose. Fun to sit and let the cats come to you. There is a second room with full light and also lots of seating areas for cats and humans . Very clean! Amazingly friendly staff.\nThere are binders with all the cat information in case you like to adopt one.\nHighly recommended activity to have fun and support a good cause!",

I came here with friends as a birthday gift to myself, I’m so glad I did. It is very calming sitting with the cats! They dim the lights and play soothing music while the cats just roam around. It is also extremely clean and the restroom smells great as well! They do provide binders all around the sitting area so you can learn about each cat, along with how to adopt one if you fall in love with one of the fur babies! As well as the cat petting, they provide you one free drink — whether that be hot coffee, hot tea, soda, chocolate milk, or cold water! They also sell reasonably priced products, such as jewelry, cat toys, shot glasses, little pastries, and they even have cans of alcohol for sale (if that’s your thing!). I would 100% recommend this lovely place to anybody who even remotely enjoys cats! There are many different areas to sit, their one rule is to never pick up any of the cats.",

The vibe was laid back, comfortable and you would not know there were 20 cats there. You could tell they were comfortable and cared for in that environment.

The cafe offers a cozy and welcoming atmosphere where you can enjoy delicious lattes while spending time with some incredibly friendly and well-cared-for cats. The cats are all available for adoption, and you can tell they are loved and treated with the utmost care by the staff. The staff themselves were wonderful—knowledgeable, kind, and always happy to share a bit of info about the cats and their personalities. Whether you're looking to adopt or just unwind with some cute cats, I highly recommend this place.",

The employees were very friendly and helpful when it came to understanding how the cafe worked and what all can be done here. I grabbed a drink, which regrettably I don't remember the name of as it was a long day, and throughly enjoy it! Once I got to hang out with the cats I felt such joy, not being able to have a cat at the moment this was the perfect opportunity to experience being around them again.

I really wanted to love this place since it's a small business and there aren't many places to get coffee nearby. The Danish was good but the frappe was not. I was disappointed. I drank half of it and was left with just a big pile of weird flavorless sno-cone-like ice filling half the cup. I've never had a frappe separate and be like that before. It didn't stay blended somehow and my drink just didn't taste that good. Maybe it was just that particular drink. I might go back one more time and just try their iced coffee instead.\nIf I do, I will adjust my review.",
