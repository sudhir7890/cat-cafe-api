The staff, food and drink, and of course the main purpose the best kittens and cats you’ve ever seen and played with. We had a great time. This place does not smell like chemicals and pet poop. It feels like you are visiting a cat spa. If its soul purpose is to help you forget your troubles then it worked. We did not go to adopt, we went to see the kitties. Sometimes you go to places and you feel like “ been there done that” I feel the opposite. This will be on my list of staycations every year. We each had some very tasty coffee and pastries before we hung out with our new furry friends. Some great things I noticed.\n1. The cats wear collars. Our cat will not wear a collar because she never got used to it. Important for identification in case your cat gets lost.\n2. No pushy sales, Not once did someone try to guilt us into adopting.\n3. Every cat or kitten is around other cats and kittens. So if we decide to adopt down the road we know the issue with your pet and your new cat should go smooth as can be.\nSorry about this long review but this place is damn near perfect.",

Upstairs you can view the cats from a birds eye view and play cat themed games or look through cat themed books.\n\nIf you want to pet the kitties it's $11/pp and is for 50 minutes with entry at the top of the hour (10 ppl at a time). We'll definitely be back for that sometime.\n\nSo glad we got to come visit.

              "text": "Visiting The Cat's Closet was such a treat! The business is split into two separate sections: a vintage clothing store and a cat lounge. You can browse the clothing selection for no charge (just like a typical shop), but to enter the cat lounge, a reservation is recommended and you'll need to pay a small fee.\n\nTheir vintage clothing is in great condition, wonderfully well-organized, and very reasonably priced! I was also pleasantly surprised by how much of a plus-sized selection there was. And there's a rack dedicated to items with cats on them! There are dressing rooms you can use to try things on as well, which is always appreciated.\n\nThe cat lounge was absolutely lovely! Since I went on a Tuesday it was only $2 to enter for 30 mins (every other day of the week its $7 for 30 mins). I was there at the end of the day and loved how part of the lounge was just lit by holiday lights. There's also an adorable little TV and a collection of 90s/2000s movies on VHS you can watch! All of that combined with the adorable decor throughout the lounge made for a really wonderful ambiance.\n\nThe cats themselves are very friendly and all adoptable through Bloomington Animal Care and Control! They are clearly very well taken care of and have a little private back room away from people they can can access via cat door. There lounge also didn't have any unpleasant odors, which is always nice! And there are little info sheets in the lounge where you can read about all the cats.\n\nThe owners were there when I visited and were both incredibly sweet! They were readily available and happy to answer any questions about the clothes or the cats.\n\nIt is worth noting that this isn't a cat café in the sense that they don't sell any café drinks. But there are plenty of other cafés in the area where you could grab something before or after visiting!  (Morgenstern's is a personal favorite of mine on that side of town.)\n\nOverall, I loved this place! I will definitely be back to visit several more times and look forward to catching one of their events at some point!",

              "text": "The Cat Lady Cafe is truly a special place. After losing our beloved dog of nearly 15 years, we were hesitant about bringing another pet into our lives. As self-proclaimed “dog people,” the idea of adopting *cats*—and not just one, but two—seemed completely out of character. With young children and a busy lifestyle, a puppy simply wasn’t an option, but our seven-year-old had been asking for a cat for over a year. Meanwhile, our three-and-a-half-year-old, who is still learning to be gentle, made us cautious about introducing any new animals into the family.\n\nWe knew if we adopted, it would need to be a pair of littermates, and we had to be certain our youngest could handle the responsibility and respect the animals.\n\nEnter the Cat Lady Cafe. Not only did they serve an excellent latte (and adorable “coffee” — aka milk in coffee cups — for the kids), but they gave us the perfect environment to observe our children’s behavior around cats. The cafe offered us a calm, cozy space to connect as a family and really consider what pet ownership would look like. We visited at least four times before making a decision. The mix of ensuring our kids were ready, finding cats with personalities that matched our family, and taking the time to think it through gave us the confidence to move forward.\n\nUltimately, we adopted two brothers—now named Goose and Maverick—who are settling in beautifully and already quite spoiled! I believe the cats at Cat Lady Cafe are well-adjusted to noise and people, which has helped them socialize quickly in their new home.\n\nKim, the owner, clearly has both a vision and a passion for what she’s created here. I love that we were able to *adopt, not shop*, while supporting such a thoughtful and meaningful endeavor. The Cat Lady Cafe gave us not just two new furry family members, but also a sense of confidence that this was the right decision for us.\n\nIf you’re considering adoption or simply looking for a peaceful hour surrounded by cats, good coffee, and a welcoming environment, I highly recommend visiting. Goose and Maverick thank you, Kim!",

The idea of a cat cafe is amazing in theory, but my issue is one thing and one thing only.\n\nThey charge you to actually interact with the cats. Which we found to be a turn-off.\n\nIt turns out this specific place is associated with the Humane Society. So what happens basically is you enter the cafe and are able to purchase food, drink and items if you choose.  There are some tables in the back to sit at if you would like.  The cats are in a separate room, there are windows all around so you can see them visually but they cannot be touched unless you pay to go in the room with them,  and it wasn't cheap in my opinion. They charge per person by the hour if I remember correctly.\nI just remember when she told us the cost, there were 6 of us, and it was way too much to pay just to sit in a room with cats.\nI would advise if this is something you're interested in doing to call in advance so you know what to expect.",

Reservations are required. They have bottles of wine to buy, magnets, smoothies, snacks, pop and toys for the \"kids\". They ranged in age from a year to a 8 years old and you could adopt on the spot! They are well-behaved and each is named with their own personality. Nice part is you can have a conversations with lovely people who are of like mind and love domesticated, loving little kings and queens of your jungle!👑🐈‍⬛🐈😻😽",

The guy monitoring the cat lounge was very helpful and informative.\n\nI do wish, however, that young children were limited or even not allowed to be in the room without someone responsible watching them. It kind of put a damper on our visit to have them chasing the cats off and being aggressive with them. They got scratched and bitten several times because they do not understand how to approach cats and their parent did nothing to correct or control them. She actually encouraged them to bother specific cats that we were clearly spending time with. At least one of the cats was visibly stressed the whole time they were in the room. I was happy to see them leave!\n\nThat was obviously a parenting problem, but the staff do need to set some boundaries or constantly be in the room to discourage this type of behavior and/or remove people from the room when needed.\n\nOverall, I would definitely visit again! Maybe I’ll just pay for all 10 spots to make sure we have a calm and pleasant experience. 😉",

All of the cats there are super sweet and there is a booklet to learn more about each kitty available.\n\nYou do not need a reservation but it is advised.

The cats were a little dirty and their noses and eyes looked in rough shape.\n\nThere was one worker/volunteer that was on his steam deck in the cat lounge and only got up to roughly pick up the cats. Cats are not toys, the way this person picked up and handled the cats was very concerning and I hope there will be some accountability.\n\nLike I said, the 3 stars are for the concept and I can tell that they care about the cats and getting them adopted.\n\nBut there needs to be stricter training and discipline involved. Employees/volunteers should be working (not playing games) and maybe helping clean the area and the cats. They should also not be handling the cats so violently.\n\nPlease address these issues for the sake of improving the quality of care for these cats.",
