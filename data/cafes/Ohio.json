We have the feline plus membership and it is so cost effective to go that route if you live in the area. We absolutely love coming here, and have always been treated with so much kindness by the staff. The owner, Patty, is a lovely person. I am so happy that this place exists in BG and we can have it as a weekly sanctuary for when life gets stressful. It truly is our happy place. With the membership, you and the other person you bring each get a drink from the fridge included, also. I am not a huge coffee person, but they seem to have many different choices for syrups and the coffee machine is always working. Cats are so adorable and sweet!! Always clean, too.",

There are lap cats, scaredy cats, cats that like being held, some that play, and cats just generally running amuk everywhere!  There were a couple bunnies even, but they stayed hidden.  It is much cheaper than other cat \"cafes,\" but this is not a cafe.  There are some snacks and drinks available for donation, but some snacks were expired....like WAY expired (over 1 year).  It is a store front with a lot of cute, niche cat and dog items.  The cats are in the back two rooms, and an outdoor area.  The staff has always been super friendly and welcoming, with no pressure when time is up.  Speaking of which, not only is it cheaper than other places, you get a lot more time for that cheaper cost.   All that being said, I should give it 5 stars, but I debated even dropping it to 3.  It smells.  Like real bad.  It is dirty, like real dirty.  There is a lot to take care of here, and it's somewhat understandable, especially with an outdoor area that is freely accessible.  But, I feel it could be better maintained.  There is a bathroom to clean up, so thanks for that...but I can't help but feel dirty and greasy after leaving.  The cats look well fed and taken care of, the litter boxes aren't overflowing or anything, but it'd be nice if they did a little more to keep it cleaner and reduce the smell.  You get used to it, somewhat, but it is overpowering at first.  I was on the fence about taking my kids back a third time because it's slightly gross, but nonetheless we went and all had a good time.",

They offer cat treats and toys for sale for the kitties so we bought the kitties some treats which you also get to feed to the cats! They also offer a few beverages and snacks for purchase for yourself. They do accept cards with a minimum purchase of $10 and cash. We just went to visit not to adopt so we didn’t stay very long so that people who did want to adopt could spend more time finding their kitty of choice. Your ticket gets you a 50 min time slot to get to know the cats. With your ticket to Ruby Cats you also get a discount on Grindhrs coffee across the street and they were just as friendly and helpful.

The place was immaculate. It was very clean and free of odors. I’m not a cat person (my daughter is though- hence why we went!), and I fell in love with cats right there and then.\nYou can really tell they care about the safety and wellbeing on the cats. They’re all very clean and healthy. The place is calm and welcoming for both cats and humans. The cats have a large variety of places to go play, hide, sleep, etc., and cat toys are available in every room. We loved reading about each cat and getting to know them all. We were even given treats to feed the cats. The drinks were great, and my daughter tried the (“very artistic”) red velvet cakepop. A friendly staff member kept coming in to check in and answer any questions. If we ever decide to adopt a cat, this would be the only place we would adopt from.",
