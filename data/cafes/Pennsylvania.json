The cats are all up for adoption, and Purrista does a great job of ensuring cats are happy, calm, and relaxed in the cafe while they're being pet.\n\nEnjoy the atmosphere and be calm. They offer shoe covers, as they don't allow shoes in the same room as the cats, and also give plenty of sanitizer wipes and lint rollers to clean up afterwards.\n\nDefinitely recommend!",

I loved the setup of a regular cafe on one side, which opens early morning, and a cat area on the other (opens at 11). I got some work done, had a nice cup of tea in one of their cute mugs, then went to the cat side when it opened. Immediately one of the younger cats attached himself to me and slept on my lap and shoulders while I finished my work. The other cats were so cute too! Great vibes, very clean (you take your shoes off for the cat area so wear socks). Every other cat cafe I've been to just kinda pours coffee from a pot or a cup of juice into a paper cup lol, and no food. By separating the cafe from the cat area, Purrista stands as a legitimately good coffee shop on its own!",

Another brick and mortar business but this caught my eye and was surprised there was a cat cafe nearby us!!\n\nThis is unusual for me to give 4 stars.\n\nI took one less star because they don’t want any kids under 5. Their rule and I had leave my 3 year old son at home rather than enjoying this cat cafe experience with his big brother.\n\nPlace is kept clean. Friendly, one in particular who was very nice.\n\nI didn’t catch their names as they were not wearing one\n\nTea, coffee or any snacks are not part of the ticket when you get into their kitty coral\n\nWould i come back again…? Most likely not\n\nOtherwise, the cat experience satisfied my son to play with their cats for 25 minutes.\n\nIt is highly recommended to book your cat experience through their website. It does have a fee to book it and they would charge credit card processing fee if you were to purchase something in store.\n\nWe only book the 25 minutes and here is what I’ve paid for\n\nIt’s $10 per adult\n$7 for children 5-12 year old",

But I have come to learn that this is a non-profit operation where all the proceeds benefit the needs of homeless, abandoned, injured and sick cats and kittens.  Wow! They were very accommodating to us when we had to keep changing our reservation. Kudos to them!!!  The actual food was just okay.  My home fries were burned.  My French toast was mildly tasty.  The creamed chipped beef had a very odd flavor (too eggy or too much uncooked flour).  Nothing was extraordinary, but I applaud the cause.",

Everything was a 10/10. The wrap, chicken was cooked perfectly, bacon was good and crisp, ranch tasted so good, all of it combined was heaven. The cinnamon roll was HUGE, its a MOUTAIN roll, it's so different than store brought, the icing is so different from store brought but its the best cinnamon roll icing i ever tasted, let alone the BEST cinnamon roll I've tasted in my whole 17 years. It's the most softest, tastiest, mouth watering cinnamon roll you'll EVER come across. and then the tiramisu iced coffee, OH MY GOD. i never taste anything like that, its so unique and genius. i just love it. no words.\nmy friend only got the mini breakfast pizza bacon egg and cheddar. i tasted it, THE BREAD IS SUPER SOFT, YOU NEED TO TRY. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT TRY ITT. ITS SO GOOD SOFT AND SMELLS GOOD.\n\nI HIGHLY RECCOMEND TRYING THAT WRAP AND CINNAMANROLL. also if they have that s'more brownie TRY IT, i sadly wasn't able to today but soon.\n\nnow for the cats.\n$8 per person for 30 minutes.\nand i THINK $12 for 60 minutes per person.\nthere's hand sanitizer and lint rollers already, there's a door to the cat room and then a gate. there's cat toys so you can play with them. i heard if you go early most of the cats are up (I'm not positive) I went around 3:30PM.\nthe big chunky black cat is ace, I LOOVE HIM. HE WOKE UP FORM HIS SLUMBER AND INSANTLY CAME TO ME. THE WHITE ONE was so cute, look at the pink paws. literally so adorable. theres a kitten too, SO MANY CATSS.\n\nthe atsmposphere was nice, I wasn't able to get pictures because I was least focus on that but its a nice quiet cafe, i feel like i can work on my school assignments there peacefully. they have music but its low, and the staff was friendly.\n\noverall i REALLY recommend this place.",

The entire place is immaculately clean.  They also have a small section to purchase gifts and miscellaneous items.  To visit the cats there is a small fee from $5.00 a person for 15 minutes to $10.00 for 30 minutes.  They do take reservations for visits and I can imagine that is necessary at times.  You must also remove your shoes and sanitize your hands before entering.  Picking up the cats is not allowed and sleeping cats are not to be disturbed.  You can pet and play with the cats if they decide you are worthy lol.  They do a great service for unwanted cats by fostering them until homes can be found.

              "text": "Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon.  We are not newbies to this concept as we are regulars at Cats in Bloom in Bloomsburg PA.\n\nThe good:\nCats are clearly well cared for.\nThe room was the appropriate size for the number of cats.\nCats had access to clean water and food.\nCats had plenty of toys and some safe spaces if they didn’t want to socialize.\n\nThe bad:\nI 1000% disagree with the age policy (kids of all ages are allowed).  There were 3 kids there when we arrived (all clearly no more than age 7-8).  Two of them were relentlessly following cats around that clearly didn’t want to socialize with them.  One cat “warned” one of the kids multiple times but she didn’t stop.  Literally all of the cats but 1-2 were in a hiding spot.  Then a mom with FOUR kids walked in (age range was probably 5-10). That’s when we left.  I just couldn’t watch these kids stressing the cats out any longer.  Also - this was not a large room and there were now 8 adults and 7 kids in there.\n\nMy opinion may not be popular but I dont believe the owner’s intent is for this to be a petting zoo when it’s too cold for your kids to go outside.  And I realize an age policy may reduce the number of visitors - I’d happily spend more on admission to see these cats not have to deal with the stress of young children.\n\nI also think there should be a reservation system or a time limit or some way to cut down on the number of people in that room at one time.  At least at high traffic times.\n\nI really love this concept but there needs to be an age policy and you need more space.  Personally I would get rid of the cafe side and make the whole thing cat visitation.",

The fee goes directly to supporting the organization and the care of these furry friends.\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and clearly passionate about their feline residents. They're happy to share information about each cat's personality and care, which adds a personal touch.  While the cat area is cozy, it's a clean and comfortable space with plenty of seating for around 6 people.  There are even a few toys available so you can engage and play with the cats!\n\nWhat's even better is that all the kitties are available for adoption.  They've partnered with a local rescue, giving these furry friends a chance to find their forever homes.\n\nIt's the perfect spot to unwind and de-stress with some feline company.  Parking is easy, too, with spots available along the side of the road and a parking area across the street. Highly recommend a visit!",

            "text": "Four Green Cats Cafe - WORTH the wait!\n\nFour Green Cats Café is an absolute gem - a fabulous coffee shop specializing in Czech & European-inspired sweets and savories that are as delightful - unique. My Caramel Latte was perfectly craft, but my latte, amazing as it was, couldn’t compete with the star of the show: a freshly baked, hot-out-of-the-oven savory doughnut.\n\nThis isn’t your average savory doughnut. It’s a sweet and savory pastry stuffed with tangy sauerkraut, a slice of sausage, cherry tomato, a sweet pickle slice, and fresh greens. With every bite, my taste buds were intrigued and delighted. The balance of flavors had me wanting to lick my plate!  I didn't : )\n\nThe café is cozy and inviting, and the “Cats” (slang for pretty girls and referring to the owner & her family) know their pastries! I managed to resist the German bread pudding and other indulgent sweets, they looked incredible !\n\nBe sure to check out the café’s history online - there is a wonderful article worth reading. The owner and her family (Cats) have truly created a landmark that’s just slightly off the beaten path, both physically and in its distinctive cuisine.\n\nSO WHY did I say it was worth the wait?  During the hustling months, the line can be quite long, BUT don't let that deter you!  The wait is worth it for both coffee and authentically created food.  Don’t miss it—visit Four Green Cats Café soon!",

The food is authentic, reminiscent of what people would have eaten in the 1920s—simple and original, without any of the fancy additives developed in recent times to manipulate taste buds. It’s genuinely good. I would definitely come back to try more unique drinks and dishes. The staff is attentive and always goes above and beyond to make your experience special.
