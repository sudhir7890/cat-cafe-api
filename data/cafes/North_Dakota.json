            "text": "I‚Äôd been hearing about this place for some time through Facebook chatter and I decided to come check it out. I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect. It was a cold and foggy day, so a piping hot coffee and snack seemed like a good idea. We set out to Coffee and Cats for our first experience. The store is on Saint Patrick‚Äôs street just, next to a daycare and across the street from Calvary Church. As we approached I could see a little sign in the window displaying an artistic rendition of a cat with the words ‚ÄúCoffee, Because Murdered is Wrong‚Äù.  I burst out laughing because I happen to love cats, and the depiction was purrfect. Teaching one of the Ten Commandments across the street from a church using cats and coffee to get the point across seemed oddly appropriate.\n\nIn we go to a very cozy atmosphere, with cool ceiling tiles, plush couches, eclectic wall art and an ample supply of coffee flavors abound. Steam is rising through the air out of a nicely equipped coffee machine. From around it comes one of the owners to welcome us in. Very nicely done. Each choice is cat-related and I decided to go simple. I got the Siamese (Vanilla and Cinnamon) and our second was the hot coco (with marshmallow and graham cracker). After placing our order we had time to look at the delectable offerings in the glass case.\n\nCookies, pastries and fun stuff like the jiggly kitty infused with a flavored tea and milk. I got one of those too. It was a hard choice I must admit.\n\nWe opted to see the cats and made a donation. The cats are in an enclosure with clear windows so you can watch them play on the many obstacle courses inside. The entire store is very clean and well kept. I was wondering how you mix cats and coffee and now I had the answer. Both coffee and coco were amazing. The little jiggly kitty not only tasted great, but provided quite a bit of entertainment before taking the spoon to split its head open. I didn‚Äôt feel bad at all.\n\nOnce we were finished it was time to see the cats. We were guided over to the door, given friendly and clear instructions, provided sanitizer and sprayed our shoes before entering. We were greeted by some friendly cats who wanted attention and others that simply stayed where they were. All-around it was fun. We didn‚Äôt end up taking a cat home, but that‚Äôs not required and it was really enjoyable!\n\nThe owners are three young adults. I‚Äôm not sure of their age, but it was impressive to see entrepreneurial endeavors such as this with our youth. Way to go!\n\nIt‚Äôs worth it to take a drive over here and support such a cool place, great owners and a unique concept with wonderful coffee, coco, pastries and cats to entertain. I encourage you to support them and I intend to go back again, especially during the winter months when I feel like a sweet, a coffee, great service and a few cats to look and laugh with.\n\nCongrats on your business and count me in as a customer and cheerleader for you guys!",

            "text": "We originally had a very good experience and shared super positive things on Google and social media. I even had people in the Reno/Tahoe area reach out about adopting from this cafe and rescue and I gave them a rave review about our experience here. However, a few hours after our visit we noticed an extra charge to our bank account. We were charged an additional $10.00 for apparently breaking the rules. When I asked what rules were broken, I did not get a response. We were extremely respectful and honestly this is just kind of ridiculous. We cannot think of anything that we did that warrants an extra fee. I love cats and I just suffered a miscarriage not even 2 weeks ago. My husband did this for me to get me out of the house and feeling better. Its not about the money but the deception. We were never warned during our visit or told we were breaking the rules. If they had made us aware of the charge, we could have better prepared, but instead it overdrafted our spending account resulting in an extra $50 in fees. I am extremely disappointed as this is the only cat cafe in Reno and I was excited to be able to interact with cats even though we can't adopt one right now. The cats seem well taken care of but this is not good business practice. We didn't even really feel like we could relax with the cats because the staff were almost hovering. They made conversation which was nice, but we were tip-toeing around trying not to make anyone or any of the cats uncomfortable. I am truly disappointed but we've agreed we won't be back.\n\nAlso, it seems the owner's only response to people with this same experience is that the policy was agreed upon multiple times. And she's right. But it is also very sneaky to act as though everything is fine and not mention a single thing to either of us and then charge us after we've left. We agreed to the policy because we thought if anything were to happen, they would at least speak up and warn us before immediately deciding to charge us with no warning. It seems like a money-grab considering how many people its happened to.\n\nAs I can't respond to the owner's comments directly but hopefully they see this. My husband and I were informed about all of the cats before interacting with them by the older employee. While she warned us that Duchess was temperamental/not the friendliest, we were not explicitly told not to approach her. That simply was not communicated. In fact, she told us that Duchess tends to be more friendly towards men!! Which is why he went to her in the first place. My husband was told twice that the cat had reached her limit. Saying multiple times makes it seem like it was higher. He was gentle and she did not lash out. He was not scratched or bitten. She was clearly not as stressed as you make it out to seem, she did not move from the exact position she was in when he approached her. I noticed you have cameras in the cat lounge so if you were not there to observe our visit, I suggest you look at the footage. The cat was perfectly fine after the interaction and so was he. The staff never once told him to stop, they said she had reached her limit. It's fine if that is what is considered a warning, but why not tell us we were going to be charged before we left? That is deceptive. They acted as if everything was perfectly fine. They never said we were breaking the rules. He did not intend to stress her out or harm her, that was clear. I'd understand the fee if he intentionally messed with her to piss her off, but that's just not what happened.",

            "text": "Enchanted Cat Cafe feels like a sanctuary for both feline enthusiasts and adoptable cats alike. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by the employees and once you enter the cat portion, a sense of tranquility instantly washes away the stresses of the outside world.\n\nThe atmosphere is serene and calming, with soft ambient music playing in the background. Their drink options are varied from hot chocolate, coffee, many types of teas, and alcoholic beverage varieties.\n\nBut the true stars of the show are, of course, the cats. Roaming freely throughout the cafe, these furry residents exude an air of contentment, basking in the attention of visitors. From playful kittens to sweet and sleepy seniors, each cat has its own unique personality, making it impossible not to fall in love at first sight.\n\nWhether you're a cat lover looking to make a new feline friend or simply seeking a new place to hang out, I highly recommend Enchanted Cat Cafe.\n\nEven after the hour in the lounge is done, it was nice to sit in the cafe and catch up with friends.",

They dared to ask one question regarding shoes (yes, footwear is an issue here). They have a confusing flowchart about it. We emailed for clarification. The owners response was so rude that we decided to cancel. The cancellation policy shown just before you enter payment says 24 hour notice is needed. We cancelled 1 week and 1 day ahead of time. The owner has refused to refund us. Also, there is an additional $6.00 charge that the owner can't or won't explain and also won't refund.\nI notified the owner that if we didn't receive a refund in full by 10am the next day, we would be refuting the charge as fraudulent with our bank. The owner then said I was being abusive and threatening and stopped responding.\nThis place has so many weird rules and policies, it's as if the owner would rather not have any customers all. For example, if you bring a kid that's 5 years old or younger, you must HOLD THEM the entire time, otherwise they will tack on additional charges.\nThe owner (or whomever I was speaking with) is obviously not a very experienced business owner and outright childish. You can't just make things up, gaslight people, and mess around with people's money.\nWho knew dealing with a place called the \"Kitty Cafe\" would be such a nightmare.\nTo the owner: don't bother responding with any lies, I have screenshots of the conversation as well as your website and I'll post them here if I need to.\nThey also just hit the same account with a second charge while the initial charge was being disputed with the bank. The management at this place is deeply ineffective and fraudulent.",

It is also extremely clean and the restroom smells great as well! They do provide binders all around the sitting area so you can learn about each cat, along with how to adopt one if you fall in love with one of the fur babies! As well as the cat petting, they provide you one free drink ‚Äî whether that be hot coffee, hot tea, soda, chocolate milk, or cold water! They also sell reasonably priced products, such as jewelry, cat toys, shot glasses, little pastries, and they even have cans of alcohol for sale (if that‚Äôs your thing!).

            "text": "MOUNT PURRNON CAT CAFE & WINE BAR has become a must-do for out of town kiddos visiting Northern Virginia, if you love cats and you love kiddies.\n\nMount Purrnon is located on Alfred Street just off King Street, the main 'drag' in Old Town Alexandria so everywhere you turn you are walking in historic footsteps. Parking is on the street. Payment is fed in to free standing rectangles. The receipt is placed on your car dashboard.\n\nMount Purrnon is a healthy walk towards the water with your back to the Metro. If you are lucky, you can catch Old Town's free trolley, a fun thing kids of all ages love to do. The trolley will land you near enough to the cafe allowing you to combine two kid fun events in one outing. ,\n\nThe Mount Purrnon Cafe is kitty corner to a vintage shop, around the cornerdown the street from Sephora and up the street from the amazing Torpedo Factory.\n\nEntering Mount Purrnon Cat Cafe + Wine Bar, you enter the most delightful gift shop filled with cat 'stuff' of all types, high end, crafty and lower priced fun stuff, all benefiting the charity housed in this historic house once upon a time someone, maybe, infamous in history lived there, after all, ghosts of America's fathers still live there, technically.\n\nFriendly volunteers sit waiting to take payment for adults, kids, lunch if you choose and the length of time your visit to last- 1/2 hour, an hour. I once met a young woman who pretty much spent all day there. She said she found inner peace.\n\nMount Purrnon profiles its current residents on the wall in this room so you sorta have an idea which kitties you will be greeted by upstairs AND maybe even want to take home with you if you are in the market for a furrever friend.\n\nThe stairs are a bit steep heading up to the cattery. There are steps outside, too.\n\nBefore you head up, there is a downstairs eating place with a limited menu that includes out of this world cheese melt sandwich a finicky-as-a-cat four year old I know literally inhales this sandwich. There is a cat themed bathroom on the first floor. It's sort of a nice thing to do- eat first, fill your tummy then head up the stairs.\n\nThe photos speak for themselves. I wanted to take them all but, got a better offer, two kiddos who love love love coming here to Mount Purrnon Cafe. Thank you, yet again.\n\noh yeah, photos are copyright (c) Carrie Devorah and may not be used unless given permission by me, not by google or the cafe",

My 9 and 6 year old daughters looked up at me like what?  If you are going to have color contest and give out a donut to kids for participating.  GIVE THEM A DONUT, not some token to garner more business. It is terrible practice and i hope the owners consider changing this practice.",

When we asked the server when our food would be ready because we had an event to get to in half an hour she assured us to stay because our food has been done but the chef won‚Äôt let it come out because his timing was off and didn‚Äôt get our meal done in one go. I personally find this hard to believe because I watched two of the tables around us get many parts of their meal separately.

The dog was split and grilled, and all the toppings complimented the dog nicely. The smorgasbord was well made and displayed. The strawberry jam, I believe was housemade and not overly sweet. The salmon was smoked perfectly, lots of flavor, but still juice. The cardamon soda was a big hit-refreshing. Really enjoyed the bake goodies, the tahini monster cookies was soft and flavorable and the pistachio rose muffin was devine. I do agree with the other reviewers, the prices are a bit high, but unique. Will try again.  SEPTEMBER 29th - Happy 2nd Birthday!  Breakfast was fantastic, and I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito. Made with leafse instead of a tortilla, a great crunch, and the salsa was perfect. The raspberry vanilla steamer and soda were tasty and refreshing.",

First my husband ordered a double margarita and it was a single. Ordered a second one and it was just koolaid. So terribly sweet would‚Äôve given you a headache.  My husband ordered the picture. The two meat and two sides. We waited 30 minutes for our food. The two chicken tenders, day old mashed potatoes and one piece of sausage was 25 bucks and was ice cold. I ordered the Cajun shrimp platter and the shrimp was so tough it was as if it had been cooked the day before. Our bill for two mixed drinks, two sodas, a water and pretty terrible food was $106. And unfortunately the waitress wasn‚Äôt great. She didn‚Äôt come back to get plates for a long time and had to get up and ask for the check. I get that if you‚Äôre having a bad day, yeah it sucks. But the place was empty. Took the bartender 10 min to make one shot of us. We tip our waitress but the overall experience was disappointing for what we paid and the service experienced. Not sure what happened in the last few years but management and staff need to do better. Y‚Äôall would get a lot more business if the quality and cook of food was better and better service. We might try back in a few years if it‚Äôs even still in business",

Like even the Mac N Cheese was horrible, the baked potato was by far the worst baked potato I have ever had, the corn wasn't edible, the pineapple slices were not good and the meat, the part FamousxDaves is supposed to be known for, each kind I ordered was just nasty.

Instead of chasing coolness, it's the inspiration for cool. Elegant but understated. Good lively crowd enjoying their evening without being obnoxious. My mocktail was so tasty and complex. The Spanish meatballs were savory with a small hint of sweetness. The buratta with tomatoes, so many hints of flavor. The French Farmer Pizza so to unique!  The whole staff was amazing.
