The cafe had a charming atmosphere, and the cats were adorable—especially the playful kittens. I could easily see myself coming back for another relaxing visit.\n\nHowever, the only downside was that it was quite busy during my visit, and there were a few young children who seemed a bit disruptive to the cats. Some of the kids were chasing them around, which made the cats visibly distressed. One even climbed onto a table and ended up falling over, which was concerning. I feel like the cafe might be better suited for older guests who understand how to interact gently with animals. Overall, a great spot for cat lovers, but best enjoyed during quieter times!\n\nThese pictures are from my first visit :)",

We weren't as familiar with the area, but were ready for an adventure.\n\nY'all....THIS is the one. This is the cat cafe to visit. The staff were patient and helpful, the cafe itself spans TWO floors of a classic building, now outfitted for maximum cat enjoyment. There were a wide variety of cat ages and cat temperaments - something for everyone. Nice food and drink options (but no pressure), cool info on each cat, board games aplenty for cat-adjacent hangouts....\n\nPlus...it's somehow LESS of a cost compared to others in the area? HOW?!\n\nWe've made our decision, and our family will be heading back to Cheshire Grin soon. Highly recommended!!",
