We stayed for a half hour taking in the sleeping Kitty's. A great concept to visit the cats and they are all available for adoption to find their forever homes. A great place to visit üêà and have a cup of coffee. Happy to support a business that helps the community. The staff is great as well!",

The variety of coffee, teas, etc. that Big Cat offers helps us to always find what we want and gives us ideas of new products to try.  The convenience of ordering online and having it shipped to the house is an added bonus.  We just wish the shipping charges were not so high.

The selection is fabulous, the prices comparable and the free delivery for orders over $100 is very fast. Love the blue cat special sales, great prices on expired or close to expired products. How bad can it be in a sealed pod, right? It‚Äôs not bad at all, in fact you can‚Äôt tell the difference. They deserve all the stars and I love purchasing from a (I assume) small business.
