My kids have always wanted a cat, and this visit gave them the perfect opportunity to interact and play with cats in a safe and fun environment. They absolutely loved spending time in both the kitten room and the adult cat room, getting a chance to cuddle and play with the cats for 45 minutes.\n\nThe chai tea I had was wonderful—rich and perfectly spiced—and the cake pops were a delicious treat that everyone enjoyed. Although visiting on the weekend was a bit pricier, I learned that weekday rates are slightly lower, which is great for planning our next visit. Overall, it was a fantastic experience for both me and my kids, and we left with smiles all around!",

I asked the staff lady, and she told me that the reason he was in the room was because he had been harassing the female cats when he was out earlier.

For $10, I was able to spend an hour with like 10 cats. Most were young, spritely felines. They were all SO sweet. The volunteer gave us the low down on each cat (name, temperament, story if known). We were given toys and treats to give the resident babies. It was truly a dream come true. I can't wait to go back. It is my new favorite coffee shop in the area.

              "text": "Java Cat is a wonderful place!  The coffee is great - always hot and fresh, with a big choice of milk and creamers, and the cold brew is excellent. They have a great selection of teas and other drinks, fresh bakery, a lunch and dinner menu that includes kids options  and delicious gelato. There is plenty of easy parking so it is easy to  pick up takeout or park to eat in.\nThe service is super friendly and quick and the space is wonderful.  There is lots of uncrowded seating and it’s a perfect place to read or get some work done on your own, or hold a work meeting or a gathering of friends.  The space is bright and cheerful, full of art and light, and unlike many restaurants the acoustics are very human- friendly.  Even during the busy times you can hear each other talk and also hear yourself think.\nThere’s a great children’s area with cushions and games right in the front dining space and the children of regular customers seem very much at home there.  There’s a ramp to the front entrance,  the space and bathrooms are accessible, and the staff are happy to shift tables and chairs around.\nThe outside is a real hidden treasure of a space  with outdoor seating areas, a great breeze, your choice or sun or shade, a peaceful vibe and a visiting family of sandhill cranes.\nIt is pet friendly with leashed dogs allowed in a portion of the space, and waste bags and water bowls  provided.\nI look forward to visiting Java Cat often! 🐈‍⬛☕️🐈‍⬛",

Spaces to settle in both outdoors (in season) and in; sometimes live music.
