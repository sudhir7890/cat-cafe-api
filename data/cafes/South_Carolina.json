I’m not a cat person (my daughter is though- hence why we went!), and I fell in love with cats right there and then.\nYou can really tell they care about the safety and wellbeing on the cats. They’re all very clean and healthy. The place is calm and welcoming for both cats and humans. The cats have a large variety of places to go play, hide, sleep, etc., and cat toys are available in every room. We loved reading about each cat and getting to know them all. We were even given treats to feed the cats. The drinks were great, and my daughter tried the (“very artistic”) red velvet cakepop. A friendly staff member kept coming in to check in and answer any questions. If we ever decide to adopt a cat, this would be the only place we would adopt from.",

Every person in there was just happy and relaxed and smiling the entire time. If you’re looking to adopt, this is a great option. Even in just an hour you can really get to know the temperament and personality of some of the cats.  Some are more snuggly, others more playful, and of course there are some that are a bit more spicy.  They partner with local shelters, and the people there are amazing to talk to about each cat, and how long they’ve been there and what they’re like.\n\nWe actually ended up going in twice during our stay in Charleston, and the second time decided to go with the ‘Cat Whisperer’ package. If you really want to make sure you get a few cats interacting with you, or in your lap, then they give you a little bit of treats and catnip. It’s still a great time without it, and there are toys and things all around to play with for everyone to use.  Be careful though, it’s gonna be hard to leave without wanting to bring one home with you.",

There were other people in the room, but it wasn’t crowded at all. There were plenty of places to sit and many interactive toys to play with. It was clean and the cats were well cared for. They had places to climb and they could get away from the humans if they wanted to. All the cats were so sweet and playful. The hour went way too quickly!

It luckily wasn’t busy and had to wait long, but I can definitely see getting annoyed with people in front of you ordering and taking forever not knowing how to use an iPad ordering system and have multiple things to order. After you order they then will call out your name at the next window to the left of the kiosk station.\n\nEither way, I definitely would come back here again because of the quality of the coffee and food were really good in my opinion.",

The owner was more than accommodating- she explained the menu and even suggested samples before we ordered to make sure we got coffee that we really enjoyed! She went above and beyond to make sure our experience was excellent. They make all of their syrups and even roast their own coffee! The inside has a few tables and does have AC, she does lock the front door though always so just order at the window first and she will give you a table inside if you’d like, or there are lots of spaces outside to sit too! I had the lavender cold brew and it was delicious. My friend who came with got a decaf latte with spiced brown sugar syrup (which was homemade) & that was fantastic too! They also have some Cuban coffee that I would love to give a try too! We didn’t order food, but would’ve gotten a bagel, frittata (only served on weekends), donut, or sandwich. Highly recommend this cozy, welcoming coffee shop!",

Drinks were allowed into the cat lounge. They had seasonal flavors for coffee, and the cafe was decorated very nicely for the holiday season. The cat room itself was spacious, with a variety of cat toys to use. There was a TV in the corner of the room that played a slideshow with images and names of the cats, and all of the cats are listed online as well.

(we didn’t pick up the black kitty i think his name is Sags he hopped onto my BF to try to get his straw but we respected every rule for their safety)\nI also love how you can adopt them as well, MASON MY BELOVED ILL MISS YOU FOREVER i wish i could have gotten him i love his little curly belly and his cuddliness!!\n\nWe got a hazelnut frappe and a lavender frappe and it was so yummy!

Check it out!\n\nThe cats were also friendly and curious when we went, especially the orange cat, Chives! He thought he was the king in the castle 🏰 and owner of the cafe 😀. Full of personality! If you are looking to adopt a cat, definitely check this place out and maybe you’ll be lucky enough to meet Chives while there 🥰. He was up for adoption too!\n\nEach time slots 1 hour. Plenty of time to finish your drinks and pet/play with the cats! The cats like the really fluffy toy that looked like bird feathers. If you shake it real fast, cats get very into it (maybe thinking it’s a fluttering bird 🦅😀)!\n\nI wish there was a larger waiting room area. We arrived kind of early and there’s just one table with 2 chairs in the waiting room. But the place is tiny, so I understand the space constrains. You can always wait outside on the porch or look around for cute merchandise.\n\nBy the way, I got a lavender matcha tea at the cafe and it was excellent!

While we appreciate that the entry fee helps support stray cats, the $8 per person charge for just 30 minutes felt excessive—especially for a larger family. On top of that, purchasing drinks added to the overall cost, making it an expensive outing.\n\nWhat made it even more disappointing was that there were only three cats out to play, and with another couple in the room, interaction was minimal. We mostly just sat and watched the cats, which we could have done from the window without paying admission.\n\nWe understand that caring for the cats requires funding, but a lower entry fee—or at least ensuring more active interaction with the cats—would make it a better experience. If the pricing were more reasonable, we’d be happy to visit more often and support the cause. Unfortunately, at its current cost, we won’t be returning.",
