All of the cats there are so sweet and special and fun in their own ways:) It’s kept so clean in the lobby and they make amazing coffee that you definitely have to try when you are there! The workers are so so kind and will chat with you for 20 minutes about the cats if you want to which is pretty awesome! Definitely recommend going here and we will be back soon!! Someone give clementine a little hug for us too:)",

              "text": "Paws down, this was such a wonderful experience and did my soul some much needed good.  I’m reading these nasty reviews and they are such an inaccurate portrayal of what this facility truly is.  If one actually takes the time to read the information presented on the website, in the facility, or on any of the paperwork or even their social media they states the rules clearly. As a very experienced cat owner myself this concept is wonderful. Not only do these cats get to be free of cages, playing, and clearly well cared for; It gives potential adopters the opportunity to see how they behave in less stressful environment.  Just like humans, cats have social batteries too. They have needs and their emotional well-being/needs to be taken into consideration which is EXACTLY what they are doing at Phoenix Cat Cafe.  Every single person that I interacted, with was kind, knowledgeable about each cat, and professional.  The facility is so clean and these cats are as happy as they can be in this environment. These negative comments on here are just taking jabs at employees because they weren’t getting what they wanted which sounds more like an entitlement problem than a Phoenix Cat Cafe problem.  We had a first spot morning reservation, which we booked for 2 adults, because we read and used our comprehension skills based on the VERY CLEAR information on the website (and Instagram and when you walk in the door…).  We purchased coffee prior to visiting the cats, we read the posted rules, followed directions and proceeded into the cat area quiet and respectfully.  We took a seat on the floor and within seconds we were surrounded and greeted by several cats. The kind woman who was working even took the time to tell us who each cat was (mind you there were over 20) and she knew all of them.  The bonded pairs, their stories, and individual health needs.  She told us about the Manx (I love and can’t stop thinking about Clem 😻) and the cat with one eye - they were both content, loving and happy.  I love that they enforce the rules about bringing children into the facility. This isn’t a petting zoo. These are animals who have been ditched, abused, scared, and the last thing they need is to be stressed out by a bunch of kids running around in THEIR space.  I’m saying this as a parent and cat owner. I have zero bad things to say about this place and the only thing I wish I could’ve done was take one of these sweet little babies home.  Mine at home are not open to this.  I love having the option of being able to have coffee with a friend and love on some furry friends in the process. Cats are far better than most people anyways.  Even if you aren’t in the market to adopt a cat, it gives you the ability to socially interact and show some cats who need some love just that. Keep doing what you’re doing Phoenix Cat Cafe - I can’t wait to visit again.  Please give Miss Clem so love for me.  (I’d love to work in the new location whenever that opens.)",

It is not an actual cat cafe, but it’s an hour of free play with the kitties. They have various ages of cats from kitten to adult. Most of them are always up for adoption. The adoption process was so easy, I applied the same day and picked up my cat the next day. If you have one cat and looking for another, this is the place to go! Since they’ve already been around cats before, the introduction process was very quick and my cats are now definitely best friends. Only con is I don’t think I could go back because I would end up bringing home another and my boyfriend would not be too happy. Would recommend to friends and family looking for a cat.",
