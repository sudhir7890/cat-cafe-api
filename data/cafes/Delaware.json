The newest interior is gorgeous and you can tell the cats have lots of stimulating toys and places to climb, run and sleep. I actually adopted my first cat from Treetops and they helped me with all my anxious cat questions and followed up with me multiple times after adoption. My kitty was previously feral and they were honest with me about her entire situation and history. She is an anxious girl but so am I and we are truly peas in a pod. We are constantly with each other at home and I am so so lucky to have this angel of a kitty. Thank you Treetops!! I recommend them 100%",

The fee goes directly to supporting the organization and the care of these furry friends.\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and clearly passionate about their feline residents. They're happy to share information about each cat's personality and care, which adds a personal touch.  While the cat area is cozy, it's a clean and comfortable space with plenty of seating for around 6 people.  There are even a few toys available so you can engage and play with the cats!\n\nWhat's even better is that all the kitties are available for adoption.  They've partnered with a local rescue, giving these furry friends a chance to find their forever homes.\n\nIt's the perfect spot to unwind and de-stress with some feline company.  Parking is easy, too, with spots available along the side of the road and a parking area across the street. Highly recommend a visit!",

They were very accommodating to us when we had to keep changing our reservation. Kudos to them!!!  The actual food was just okay.  My home fries were burned.  My French toast was mildly tasty.  The creamed chipped beef had a very odd flavor (too eggy or too much uncooked flour).  Nothing was extraordinary, but I applaud the cause.",

We couldn't find her half the time. It took us an hour before we started eating, and she never returned to the table to see if we needed anything else. A different server brought our food out to the table from the kitchen. And there weren't that many other people in the restaurant, so we were pretty disappointed with the service. And since there were 10 of us, they charged 20% service charge, and also a blank line for additional tip, which we did not give. They even tried to cover up the 20% tip/service charge by signing their name real big across that line on the bill. I guess they thought we'd just look at the bottom line and pay that and then add another 20% tip!",

We are not newbies to this concept as we are regulars at Cats in Bloom in Bloomsburg PA.\n\nThe good:\nCats are clearly well cared for.\nThe room was the appropriate size for the number of cats.\nCats had access to clean water and food.\nCats had plenty of toys and some safe spaces if they didn‚Äôt want to socialize.\n\nThe bad:\nI 1000% disagree with the age policy (kids of all ages are allowed).  There were 3 kids there when we arrived (all clearly no more than age 7-8).  Two of them were relentlessly following cats around that clearly didn‚Äôt want to socialize with them.  One cat ‚Äúwarned‚Äù one of the kids multiple times but she didn‚Äôt stop.  Literally all of the cats but 1-2 were in a hiding spot.  Then a mom with FOUR kids walked in (age range was probably 5-10). That‚Äôs when we left.  I just couldn‚Äôt watch these kids stressing the cats out any longer.  Also - this was not a large room and there were now 8 adults and 7 kids in there.\n\nMy opinion may not be popular but I dont believe the owner‚Äôs intent is for this to be a petting zoo when it‚Äôs too cold for your kids to go outside.  And I realize an age policy may reduce the number of visitors - I‚Äôd happily spend more on admission to see these cats not have to deal with the stress of young children.\n\nI also think there should be a reservation system or a time limit or some way to cut down on the number of people in that room at one time.  At least at high traffic times.\n\nI really love this concept but there needs to be an age policy and you need more space.  Personally I would get rid of the cafe side and make the whole thing cat visitation.",

Parking is on the street. Payment is fed in to free standing rectangles. The receipt is placed on your car dashboard.\n\nMount Purrnon is a healthy walk towards the water with your back to the Metro. If you are lucky, you can catch Old Town's free trolley, a fun thing kids of all ages love to do. The trolley will land you near enough to the cafe allowing you to combine two kid fun events in one outing. ,\n\nThe Mount Purrnon Cafe is kitty corner to a vintage shop, around the cornerdown the street from Sephora and up the street from the amazing Torpedo Factory.\n\nEntering Mount Purrnon Cat Cafe + Wine Bar, you enter the most delightful gift shop filled with cat 'stuff' of all types, high end, crafty and lower priced fun stuff, all benefiting the charity housed in this historic house once upon a time someone, maybe, infamous in history lived there, after all, ghosts of America's fathers still live there, technically.\n\nFriendly volunteers sit waiting to take payment for adults, kids, lunch if you choose and the length of time your visit to last- 1/2 hour, an hour. I once met a young woman who pretty much spent all day there. She said she found inner peace.\n\nMount Purrnon profiles its current residents on the wall in this room so you sorta have an idea which kitties you will be greeted by upstairs AND maybe even want to take home with you if you are in the market for a furrever friend.\n\nThe stairs are a bit steep heading up to the cattery. There are steps outside, too.\n\nBefore you head up, there is a downstairs eating place with a limited menu that includes out of this world cheese melt sandwich a finicky-as-a-cat four year old I know literally inhales this sandwich. There is a cat themed bathroom on the first floor. It's sort of a nice thing to do- eat first, fill your tummy then head up the stairs.\n\nThe photos speak for themselves. I wanted to take them all but, got a better offer, two kiddos who love love love coming here to Mount Purrnon Cafe. Thank you, yet again.\n\noh yeah, photos are copyright (c) Carrie Devorah and may not be used unless given permission by me, not by google or the cafe",

The coffee shop is great, offering delicious baked goods and pastries ‚Äì especially their cinnamon rolls, which are by far the best I've ever had! Order one and thank me later!\n\nThe real stars of the cafe are the adorable kittens and cats! There were so many sweet and playful adoptable cats roaming around, looking for cuddles and playtime. The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about each cat, and the adoption process is done on site.\n\nWhether you're a cat lover, a coffee enthusiast, or simply looking for a unique and heartwarming experience, this cafe is for you!\n\nI‚Äôll be back with my laptop to work remotely in the cat room!  Totally worth the cost of entry to have the purrrfect remote working companions!",

            "text": "me and my friend went to this cat cafe, the closet one to reading. this is the best place ever.\n\nfor food i ordered chicken bacon ranch wrap, a HUGE cinnamon roll, and the tiramisu iced coffee.\nI'm NOT overexaggerating, that food was AMAZING. Everything was a 10/10. The wrap, chicken was cooked perfectly, bacon was good and crisp, ranch tasted so good, all of it combined was heaven. The cinnamon roll was HUGE, its a MOUTAIN roll, it's so different than store brought, the icing is so different from store brought but its the best cinnamon roll icing i ever tasted, let alone the BEST cinnamon roll I've tasted in my whole 17 years. It's the most softest, tastiest, mouth watering cinnamon roll you'll EVER come across. and then the tiramisu iced coffee, OH MY GOD. i never taste anything like that, its so unique and genius. i just love it. no words.\nmy friend only got the mini breakfast pizza bacon egg and cheddar. i tasted it, THE BREAD IS SUPER SOFT, YOU NEED TO TRY. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT TRY ITT. ITS SO GOOD SOFT AND SMELLS GOOD.\n\nI HIGHLY RECCOMEND TRYING THAT WRAP AND CINNAMANROLL. also if they have that s'more brownie TRY IT, i sadly wasn't able to today but soon.\n\nnow for the cats.\n$8 per person for 30 minutes.\nand i THINK $12 for 60 minutes per person.\nthere's hand sanitizer and lint rollers already, there's a door to the cat room and then a gate. there's cat toys so you can play with them. i heard if you go early most of the cats are up (I'm not positive) I went around 3:30PM.\nthe big chunky black cat is ace, I LOOVE HIM. HE WOKE UP FORM HIS SLUMBER AND INSANTLY CAME TO ME. THE WHITE ONE was so cute, look at the pink paws. literally so adorable. theres a kitten too, SO MANY CATSS.\n\nthe atsmposphere was nice, I wasn't able to get pictures because I was least focus on that but its a nice quiet cafe, i feel like i can work on my school assignments there peacefully. they have music but its low, and the staff was friendly.\n\noverall i REALLY recommend this place.",
