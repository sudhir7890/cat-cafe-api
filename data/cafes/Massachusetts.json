It was so much fun, we got to pet play and interact with every cat from the goofiest to the shyest that are just warming up! There are many cats with a different personality’s, ages and backgrounds! We are now trying to adopt a baby we seen there today!\n\nBest experience with great owner who knew so much about all the cats and their needs! Some great highlights to add is you get to walk with the cats that like to be in backpacks and bring them outside. Plus everything there you buy goes straight to the cats and taking care of them. Uri truly cares for all the cats and kittens no matter age, condition, or where they came from. He is patient, soft spoken, and treats them with all the love and respect they deserve. He cleans before and after every visit to keep the cats and visitors safe! And makes sure cats are handled well and known!",

She was very friendly but didn't have time for cleaning up the cat room that had a slight odor and wasn't very big. The pastries didn't look fresh either.
