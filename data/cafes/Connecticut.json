Once we arrived, we enjoyed some delicious coffee and tea while spending time with the adorable cats. The space is cozy, and the staff, especially Angela, the owner, was super friendly and welcoming. She really made our visit even more special. It’s the perfect place to relax and enjoy some time with furry friends. We had a great time and will definitely be back! Highly recommend for any cat lover!",

A cat climbed up on my lap for around 30-40 minutes. It is such a beautiful and simple experience. I recommend that everyone goes here at least once. My only complaints are  that it's is only around 1 hour! Lol! I would spend all day here if I was able to! Also, It was around 30 minutes away! I wish there were so many more of these across the world!!!!! Overall, this was one of the best experiences of my life! If it is so relaxing and so enjoyable.

They let in just a small amount of people at a time for the cats' sake, so you do not feel overcrowded. There is plenty of space and time to visit all the kitties in the room (I believe there were 6 or 7) and there are plenty of toys to use with them. They seemed well-cared for and content. We aren't in a position to adopt sadly, but there is no pressure at all if you just want to hang with them.\n\nThe beverages were so reasonably priced that I tried both an iced coffee and a hot chocolate. Both were SO GOOD and they have a variety of flavors to add to anything.\n\n10/10 will return!! The hour drive for me is worth it.",
