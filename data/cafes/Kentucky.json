Make a reservation in advance to make the most out of this visit, and be sure to pop by the cafe before entering the cat room at least 10 minutes before you enter the room of adorable and soft cats to pet and play with! Whether you’re enjoying a nice cold or hot beverage with your loved ones, this is the most clean cat facility I’ve ever been to!\nEasy access to free parking across the street and a calming atmosphere for everyone.\nI would highly recommend checking this and other cat cafes who are either looking to\nAdopt or simply to hang out with these incredibly happy felines in a clean and friendly atmosphere!",

I was skeptical at first, but this is an absolutely brilliant concept.\nThe dedicated “petting room” is full of 10ish kittens.  They are just at the age of being spayed/neutered. It’s a great way to acclimate the cats to people.  All cats are available for adoption.\nMy only complaint is the same thing as any Bardstown Road business.  Parking is horrible.\nI don’t know how one-off visits actually work,  but I highly recommend checking this place out if you have the chance.",

You can go visit the cafe anytime but might need a reservation to see the cats/kittens depending on the day of the week.\nKittens galore, swag, great coffee drinks, and don’t even get me started on the adoptions eeekkk! Once you’ve played with the kittens, you have the opportunity to take one or more home. It’s a very easy process and the kittens have already been fixed and vaccinated so you don’t even have to stop at the vet on the way home.\n\nCheck out their booking page, they have events that are great for girls and date nights. You can’t go wrong with the Purrfect Day Cat Cafe.\n\n*This is the first cafe in the nation to reach and pass 10,000 adoptions since opening its doors.

Spending time with the cats and kittens not only gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling, but helps play a crucial role in socializing them, and helping them to be adopted into loving homes. Every cat was SO cute and friendly.   The cost,  which is quite reasonable, contributes to something so much bigger, which is the wonderful mission of caring for and finding homes for abandoned cats. Your visit truly makes a difference. This was a great birthday experience to share with daughter.  Highly recommend!!",
